## Architecture
The main idea behind this project is to provide responses in the form of definitions, storytelling, instructional scenarios, translation, or scenario rectification using AI models. The user supplies PDF files, and it is the user who selects the type of response they desire. The architecture of the project revolves around leveraging AI models to process the PDF files and generate appropriate responses based on the user's chosen response type. The AI models analyze the content of the PDF files, extract relevant information, and generate responses that align with the selected response type. This architecture ensures that users receive tailored and accurate answers based on their specific requirements.
